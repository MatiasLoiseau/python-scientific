# ðŸ“Ÿ  Python Scientific 

Nowadays, python is ruling the world.  This very humble language that was once the realm of enlighted developers that loved to create the most beautiful scripting language is now becoming the programming language of the world, and particularly of the data deluge.

This repository allows you to install all the necesary stuff to start working with python on scientific applications, and particularly, to work with sensor data and neuroscience time-series.  It allows you to install everything you need and start coding with NumPy, SciPy, OpenAI and MNE.

If you don't know anything at all about python, and you want to know something that will help you to do what you need, this is one place to be.

## Contents

* ðŸ”ª Python Introduction
* ðŸ“¥ Workspace Setup
* ðŸ“ˆ Signal Processing Overview
* ðŸ”Ž Signal Analysis and Feature Extraction
* ðŸ›  Python ML/DL Tools and Techniques
* ðŸ§  Neurodata Processing


## Procedure for Windows

 * Install Python for Windows https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

 Write down the location where you install python and add it to the PATH environment variable.

 * Install Git Bash

   https://git-scm.com/downloads 
 
 * Install Visual Studio Code
 
  Download and install it from https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  
 * Clone this repository
 
  From the Git Bash console, run
  
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/faturita/python-scientific.git
 ```
 
 * Run a Git Bash Prompt or Terminal
 * Move with "cd" to the directory that you just downloaded ("cd python-scientific")

### Create the virtual environment

Up to date, the scripts are compatible with python 3.11.4.  So you need to download this python version and install it somewhere.

Then, you need to create a virtual envirnonment

 ```bash
 python -m venv ps
 ```

This will create the directory ''ps'' on current directory.  And then, activate the directory

 ```bash
 source ps/bin/activate
 ```

(or run **.\ps\Scripts\Activate on windows)

Finally you can install all the minimal requirements for this python version:

 ```bash
 pip install -r config/requirements.txt
 ```

# How to update your own repository with new changes from the server repository ?
  
  Run gitbash (windows) or start a new Console on Mac or Linux.

  First you need to upload your own changes to your OWN repository.
  
  ```bash
  git commit -m"Just write down whatever comes to your mind here" .
  ```
  
  After that you need to PULL fresh changes from the server repository at github.
  
  ```bash
  git pull origin master
  ```
  
  If you have happened to modify a file, the previous command will trigger an automatic merge.  If the merge is successful it will open a VI console (just press ':' and 'x') to add a merging comment.
  If there is any conflict, check the modified files looking for any sign of conflict (you will clearly notice it).  After you fix the merging, mark it as resolved with 'git add filename' and finish the operation with 'git commit -m"Merge fixed"'

## How to update your own repository (if it is forked) with new changes from the original repository

First, in the upper right corner of the [repository page](https://github.com/faturita/python-scientific), click on the "Fork" button. This will create a copy of the repository in your own github account. Then, go to your github profile, find the forked repository, and clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-scientific.git
```

**Optional:** Add your files and changes to your own repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Just write down whatever comes to your mind here"
git push origin master
```

Add a reference to the original repository, so you can sync changes in the future. This is known as adding an `upstream remote`:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/faturita/python-scientific.git
```

Fetch the latest changes from the original repository and merge them into your local master branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```

Finally, after merging the changes, you can update your forked repository on github to reflect the local changes:

```bash
git push origin master
```
